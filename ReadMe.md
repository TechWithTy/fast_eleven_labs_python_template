## Installation

```bash
# Install directly from PyPI
pip install elevenlabs-template

# Or clone the repository and install
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/elevenlabs-template.git
cd elevenlabs-template
pip install .
```

## Quick Start

```python
from elevenlabs_template import ElevenLabsClient

# Initialize with your API key
client = ElevenLabsClient(api_key="your_api_key_here")

# Clone a voice from an audio file
voice = client.clone_voice(
    name="My Custom Voice",
    files=["sample1.mp3", "sample2.mp3"],
    description="Professional narrator voice"
)

# Generate speech with your cloned voice
audio = client.generate_speech(
    text="Hello world! This is my cloned voice speaking.",
    voice_id=voice.voice_id
)

# Save the generated audio
with open("output.mp3", "wb") as f:
    f.write(audio)
```

## Voice Cloning

### Create a Voice Clone

```python
# Clone a voice with more options
voice = client.clone_voice(
    name="Narrator Voice",
    files=["sample1.mp3", "sample2.mp3", "sample3.mp3"],
    description="Professional narration voice with warm tone",
    labels={
        "accent": "british",
        "age": "middle-aged",
        "gender": "male"
    }
)

print(f"Voice created with ID: {voice.voice_id}")
```

### Voice Sample Requirements

For best results with voice cloning:
- Provide 1-3 minutes of clear speech samples
- Use samples with minimal background noise
- Ensure samples demonstrate the desired tone and style
- Include varied speech patterns and intonations

```python
# Check if samples meet quality requirements
from elevenlabs_template.utils import analyze_samples

sample_quality = analyze_samples(["sample1.mp3", "sample2.mp3"])
for sample, metrics in sample_quality.items():
    print(f"{sample}: Noise level: {metrics['noise_level']}, Quality: {metrics['quality']}")
```

### Manage Voice Clones

```python
# List all your custom voices
voices = client.get_voices()
for voice in voices:
    print(f"Voice: {voice.name}, ID: {voice.voice_id}")

# Get a specific voice
voice = client.get_voice("voice_id_here")

# Delete a voice
client.delete_voice("voice_id_here")

# Update voice metadata
client.update_voice(
    voice_id="voice_id_here",
    name="Updated Voice Name",
    description="New description"
)
```

## Text-to-Speech Generation

### Basic Text-to-Speech

```python
# Generate speech with default settings
audio = client.generate_speech(
    text="This is a simple text-to-speech example.",
    voice_id="voice_id_here"
)

# Save to file
with open("speech.mp3", "wb") as f:
    f.write(audio)
```

### Advanced Options

```python
# Generate speech with more control
audio = client.generate_speech(
    text="This is an example with custom settings.",
    voice_id="voice_id_here",
    model_id="eleven_multilingual_v2",  # Choose specific model
    voice_settings={
        "stability": 0.7,  # Higher stability = less variation
        "similarity_boost": 0.8,  # Higher = more similar to original
        "style": 0.5,  # Speech style transfer intensity
        "use_speaker_boost": True  # Enhance speaker clarity
    }
)
```

### SSML Support

```python
# Use SSML for more control over speech
ssml_text = """
<speak>
    <p>Welcome to our <emphasis level="strong">amazing</emphasis> new product!</p>
    <break time="1s"/>
    <p>It will <prosody rate="slow" pitch="+20%">completely transform</prosody> how you work.</p>
</speak>
"""

audio = client.generate_speech_ssml(
    ssml=ssml_text,
    voice_id="voice_id_here"
)
```

### Batch Processing

```python
# Process multiple text segments efficiently
texts = [
    "This is the first paragraph.",
    "This is the second paragraph.",
    "This is the third paragraph."
]

# Generate all speech segments with the same voice
audio_segments = client.batch_generate_speech(
    texts=texts,
    voice_id="voice_id_here"
)

# Save each segment
for i, audio in enumerate(audio_segments):
    with open(f"segment_{i}.mp3", "wb") as f:
        f.write(audio)
```

## Utilities

### Audio Processing

```python
from elevenlabs_template.utils import process_audio

# Improve sample quality
processed_audio = process_audio(
    file_path="raw_sample.wav",
    normalize=True,
    remove_noise=True,
    trim_silence=True
)

# Save processed audio
with open("processed_sample.mp3", "wb") as f:
    f.write(processed_audio)
```

### Format Conversion

```python
from elevenlabs_template.utils import convert_format

# Convert audio format
mp3_audio = convert_format(
    file_path="audio.wav",
    output_format="mp3",
    bitrate="192k"
)

# Save converted audio
with open("converted.mp3", "wb") as f:
    f.write(mp3_audio)
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Voice Settings

```python
# Experiment with different voice settings
voice_variations = []

# Create variations with different settings
for stability in [0.3, 0.5, 0.7]:
    for similarity in [0.3, 0.6, 0.9]:
        audio = client.generate_speech(
            text="The same text with different voice settings.",
            voice_id="voice_id_here",
            voice_settings={
                "stability": stability,
                "similarity_boost": similarity
            }
        )
        voice_variations.append((stability, similarity, audio))

# Save all variations
for i, (stability, similarity, audio) in enumerate(voice_variations):
    with open(f"variation_s{stability}_sim{similarity}.mp3", "wb") as f:
        f.write(audio)
```

### Streaming Audio

```python
# Stream audio for real-time applications
audio_stream = client.stream_speech(
    text="This is streaming audio that can be played while generating.",
    voice_id="voice_id_here"
)

# Process the stream
for chunk in audio_stream:
    # Process each audio chunk as it arrives
    # Example: play_audio_chunk(chunk)
    pass
```

## Best Practices

1. **Sample Quality**: Use high-quality, clear audio samples for voice cloning
2. **Text Preparation**: Break long texts into natural paragraphs or sentences
3. **Voice Settings**: Start with default settings, then adjust for desired results
4. **SSML Usage**: Use SSML for precise control over speech patterns
5. **API Key Security**: Never hardcode your API key; use environment variables

## Error Handling

```python
from elevenlabs_template.exceptions import ElevenLabsError

try:
    audio = client.generate_speech(
        text="This is a test.",
        voice_id="invalid_voice_id"
    )
except ElevenLabsError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e.message}")
    print(f"Error code: {e.status_code}")
    print(f"Request ID: {e.request_id}")
```
